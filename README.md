# openssl-csd-patches

This repository contains patches to build recent versions of OpenSSL
against the CodeSafe SDK.  Build instructions are included with your
copy of CodeSafe.

All of these patches have been tested by building OpenSSL with them,
and building and running the osld example on an nShield Solo XC.
